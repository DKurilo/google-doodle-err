You can see the shortest program lengths (in blocks) for each level.  
First level - 2 blocks  
Second level - 5 blocks  
Third level - 4 blocks  
Fourth level - 7 blocks  
Fifth level - 6 blocks  
Sixth level - 6 blocks  

## Beware! Google hides truth!
Real code length for the fifth level: 5 blocks and for sixth level: 4 blocks!  
Solution for fifth level is from: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/7hrikj/valid_shortest_solution_that_requires_40_hours_to/  

Your children shouldn't trust Google!
